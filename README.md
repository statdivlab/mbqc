The Microbiome Quality Control project contortion set out to investigate the variability in taxonomic profiling by blinding specimen sets, distributing them to 15 different sequencing laboratories, and distributing the sequencing results to 9 bioinformatics laboratories. The data is available at on the [MBQC website](https://www.hmpdacc.org/MBQC/).

Given the enormity of this dataset, we struggled to process it into a form that we could analyse in `R`. We created this repository to distribute the same data in a more convenient format for other `R` users.
